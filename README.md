# Intermittent Empty FlatList Rendering in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders an empty list, even when data is successfully fetched from an API.  The issue is particularly challenging due to its inconsistent nature, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description

A FlatList is used to display data fetched from a remote API.  Occasionally, the FlatList will render as empty, despite the `data` state containing the expected data.  This behavior is not consistently reproducible, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application on an iOS or Android emulator/device.
4. Observe that the FlatList might occasionally render as empty even with successful API calls. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the state and ensuring that the FlatList is re-rendered when the data changes. Check `bugSolution.js` for the corrected implementation.
